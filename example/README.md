# Example SES component deployment

It's a simple one. The meat is in the `convex/` directory. If you want to fire
it up, here's how:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Set up your AWS credentials (AWS_REGION, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
   and optionally SES_CONFIGURATION_SET_NAME in your deployment environment.
3. Go mess around in your Convex dashboard with `testBatch`. There is no UI!
